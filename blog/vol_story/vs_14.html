                        Abeez has been a volunteer with The Welfare of Stray Dogs for the past 2 years now and has been involved in multiple activities since then.
                        <br>
                        From someone who was scared of dogs to now being one of the favorites of the dogs at the centre, Abeez has come a long way.
                        <br>
                        He has volunteered for over 200 hours and has saved more than 60,000 rupees for the NGO till date.
                        <br><br>
                        Here's what Abeez has to say about his friendship journey with the stray dogs at WSD - 
                        <br>
                        "I used to be scared of dogs. The first time I visited the kennel was a very daunting experience for me.Eventually as the time passed by I made friends with the dogs at the kennel.
                        <br>
                        To be honest, I think the dogs accepted me and helped me overcome their fear.
                        <br><br>
                        They used to come to smell me, see if I was someone they could trust and ever since then we are the best of buddies. They now respond to my calls and actions. They now know that I'm someone they can trust fully.
                        <br><br>
                        At the Welfare Of Stray Dogs, I worked on positive practice behavior practice at the WSD center. It is essentially socializing with the dogs, playing, basic training, and grooming which is to make sure they are physically and emotionally stimulated which gives them a better chance at getting adopted. Apart from this, I worked on fundraising through product sales, vaccination and on-site first aid and adoption duties too.
                        <br>
                        Seeing some of these dogs get adopted was a bitter-sweet feeling for me as I could see them go but I knew that this was the best thing for them!
                        <br><br>
                        This experience of being friends with them has taught me how to deal with them and read them, which in turn benefits the dogs because I can give them my love now haha!
                        <br>
                        I have also grown more empathetic towards the needs of streeties.
                        <br><br>
                        The friendship day message that I would like to give you all today is someone from I don't know but it goes something like this - "Animals are such agreeable friends that they pass no judgment and ask no questions!"
