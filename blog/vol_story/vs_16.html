                        Aashka has been a dedicated volunteer since she discovered the ImpactHub website 2 years ago. So far Aashka has successfully volunteered with 2 of our NGO Partners - Spark A Change Foundation and Healing Dove Foundation.
                        <br>
                        She has volunteered for over 100 hours and created an impact of more than ₹1,20,000.
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s what she has to share about her experience -
                        <br><br>
                        "I worked with Spark-A-Change for around 2 months. It was a bittersweet goodbye when I had to leave, due to my college workload. I bonded with Ms. Avani at Spark A Change, who gave me the creative freedom to manage their social media. I also volunteered at The Healing Dove Foundation, where I worked with a few other interns.
                        <br><br>
                        At Spark A Change foundation, I managed their Facebook and Instagram accounts where the aim was to increase engagement on platforms since they didn't have much reach, and as a non-profit it's very important to properly showcase the kind of work that is done. At Healing Dove Foundation, I helped draft the relevant sections of the Bombay Public Trust Act, to ease their workload of having to go through the entirety of acts to find what applies.
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted to do a feel-good activity amidst all the chaos and tragedy, and I came across ImpactHub! I felt like I was doing something productive while helping out those who do selfless work!
                        <br><br>
                        I definitely think virtual volunteering can make a difference. Like I mentioned, it helped me feel accomplished and it's a bonus that I am doing some work for the people who actually need help in these difficult times. It's important to feel occupied and be productive even though it can be exhausting. Volunteering is a selfless activity and even the least impactful work can make you feel accomplished.
                        <br><br>    
                        Find an NGO that does the kind of work you want to be associated with, that can give you a good night's sleep when you think about what you've accomplished. Help with whatever you have to offer, even the slightest things can help in the long run. You matter and you can make a difference!"
