                            Waseem was a volunteer with the ImpactHub team, and quickly became a highly contributing
                            and impactful peer for us! This is what Waseem has to say about his experience: "I
                            volunteered with ImpactHub as a strategy consultant. As I had worked in the Strategy team
                            of a large corporation, I was able to create plans for their various events as well as their
                            financial budget for the year. I implemented a performance tracking system for them to
                            monitor their progress against the goals they had set for the year. Apart from being a
                            volunteer at ImpactHub, I have also volunteered with Teach A Class foundation where I
                            created a system for them to manage all the applications they receive from teachers so that
                            they can speedily provide tech solutions where they are needed most. My impact for
                            ImpactHub and Teach A Class Foundation was significant in terms of the value I was able to
                            generate, since I worked with both organizations pro bono. The best part about it was that I
                            was enjoying volunteering so much that I didn't even notice the hours add up! My most
                            memorable volunteering experience was at ImpactHub when I was conducting a 2-day training
                            session which took longer than expected to complete. The team unanimously agreed to stay
                            back beyond work hours to complete the session, and I saw right then how much they valued
                            the time and effort I was putting into the project!‚Äù
