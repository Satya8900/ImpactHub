                        Ramesh Adhikari has been an active volunteer with us since 2021. He has volunteered with more than 06 NGOs by helping them build, develop and update their websites. His volunteering stints have saved more than ₹ 2,00,000 for our NGOs.
                        <br><br>
                        Here's what Ramesh has to say about his volunteering journey -
                        <br>
                        "I'm a 22-year-old Web developer by education and Ethical Hacker by ambition. I have worked with more than 6 NGOs through ImpactHub as a website developer. I am a very giving person who enjoys working with NGOs.
                        <br>
                        My time as a volunteer with all the NGOs that I worked with was absolutely wonderful. I got to learn a lot of new things and how NGOs work. I have worked with more than 6 NGOs through ImpactHub to develop and build websites. As I have been working with these NGOs, I now understand how important of a role these websites could play for an NGO.
                        <br>
                        These websites help NGOs receive donations directly on their site instead of relying on third-party sites that might take up a certain amount as commissions. For some of the NGOs, I have built their website from scratch. Some of these websites were missing a lot of information which has now been updated & added to the newly designed website as per the requirements of the NGO.
                        <br>
                        For someone like me, Virtual Volunteering has opened up new possibilities and made it easier for nonprofits as well to function in the current digital society with more volunteers. It has also made it easier for people to support causes from anywhere at any time.
                        <br>
                        For those who haven't volunteered yet, I would like to say don't think twice and just go for it. You won't regret it. Volunteering will surely help you in your future."
